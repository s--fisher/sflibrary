<p>For the WB1 Canvas Assignment, you are required to submit the following text file
<a href="../../for_students/01-workbook.txt" class="for_students">01-workbook.txt</a> that contains a checklist and evaluation of your own work. You also have the option to explain your work, and in some of the later workbooks, you will be required to provide an explanation of how your submission works. You can directly modify the following text file by putting an &ldquo;x&rdquo; or &ldquo;X&rdquo; inside the square brackets, and add notes to explain your work after the colon on each line.</p>
<iframe
    title="01-workbook"
    src="../../for_students/01-workbook.txt"
    class="includebox"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the following checklist
<a href="../../for_students/01-08-01.html" class="for_students">01-08-01.html</a> to generate the content of the text file (you can click the &ldquo;Generate&rdquo; button and (1) copy the text in the text area at the bottom and paste it in &ldquo;01-workbook.txt&rdquo; or (2) click the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button to save the content of the text area to a text file). It will also give you an estimate of your grade. If you edited the text file
<a href="../../for_students/01-workbook.txt" class="for_students">01-workbook.txt</a> directly, the checklist will read your edits too.</p>

    class="includebox includebox-standard"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<p>Note: stochastic grading will use your checklist to compute your grade for some of questions (the same set of questions will not be manually graded for all students), see <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp24/pages/grading/">Grading</a> , so if you do not fill in checklist properly, you may lose points for items you completed. However, if you claim items you haven&rsquo;t completed, and the items are manually graded, you will still lose the points for that item and you may also lose an additional 10 to 20 percent for &ldquo;correct WB1 Canvas Assignment submission&rdquo; if you over-claim many items you haven&rsquo;t completed.</p>
<h2 id="canvas-wb1g-or-workbook-gallery-assignment-submission">Canvas WB1G or Workbook Gallery Assignment Submission</h2>
<p>In this box
<a href="../../for_students/01-08-02.html" class="for_students">01-08-02.html</a>, you do not have to do any coding (if you want to change the background or pen color or thickness, you can do that in
<a href="../../for_students/01-08-02.js" class="for_students">01-08-02.js</a>). Draw anything using your mouse (or touch on touchscreens) on the HTML Canvas and record it and take a screenshot at the end. You can use the screenshot/record buttons we provided, or you can use your own screenshot/screen-recording software (please do not use your camera or phone to take a picture or record a video).</p>
<iframe
    title="01-08-02"
    src="../../for_students/01-08-02.html"
    class="includebox includebox-standard"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<p>To take a screenshot, click on the &ldquo;screenshot&rdquo; button and you will be prompted to download an image file. To record a video, set a timer in the text box (the default is 10 seconds), a positive integer less than 60, and it will count down to 0 and you will be prompted to download a video file. The screenshot and recording quality is not very good: if you want images and videos with better quality, you may want to use another screenshot/screen-recording software.</p>
<iframe
    title="01-gallery"
    src="../../for_students/01-gallery.txt"
    class="includebox"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<p>If you submit before the due date, you can submit an image file and/or a video file (screenshot and/or screen-recording) and a text file
<a href="../../for_students/01-gallery.txt" class="for_students">01-gallery.txt</a> explaining what you have drawn to the WB1G Canvas Assignment. You can leave the &ldquo;Name&rdquo; as &ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo; if you do not want your real name to appear on the course website on the Gallery page. The assignment will be closed at the due date, so you will not be able to earn the 20 points for WB1G Assignment submission.</p>
<p>Note: starting from Workbook 2, the WB2G Canvas Assignment submission will be used for Gallery selection, see <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp24/galleries/">Gallery</a> for an example: you will get 10 points for submitting a screenshot or recording of your work that satisfies most of the basic requirements and another 10 points for submitting a screenshot or recording of your work that goes above and beyond the basic requirements (the decision will be based on technical merits, not artistic merits), and the actual Gallery will contain a random selection from the students who obtained 20 points.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End!</h2>
<p>This really is the end of the workbook. Don&rsquo;t forget to commit everything and push it back to GitHub. And, when you&rsquo;re done, don&rsquo;t forget to do the WB1 Canvas Assignment that tells us that your assignment is ready to be graded, and submit the WB1G Canvas Assignment if you completed the workbook on time.</p>
